# WEEK 21 RECAP — INFRASTRUCTURE AS CODE: TERRAFORM I

**Week 21 | Phase 2: Infrastructure as Code (Terraform I)**

## 🎯 Recap Objective

Consolidate Week 21's deep dive into HashiCorp Terraform, documenting the transition from manual AWS ClickOps to strict, version-controlled declarative infrastructure through a detailed recap document.

### 1️⃣ HCL Syntax & The Terraform Lifecycle

**Weekly Reflection:** Mastered the declarative syntax of HashiCorp Configuration Language and the core `init -> plan -> apply -> destroy` workflow.

### Wins & Challenges
- **Win:** Successfully provisioning a massive 15+ resource VPC via code.
- **Challenge:** Understanding state locking mechanics with DynamoDB.

**Final Assessment:** Never apply changes blindly. `terraform plan` is the ultimate safety net against destructive API calls.

---

### 2️⃣ Dynamic Configurations (Variables & Data Sources)

**Weekly Reflection:** Eliminated hardcoded strings by injecting input variables, exporting outputs, and dynamically querying the AWS API for real-time data (like AMI IDs).

### Wins & Challenges
- **Win:** Successfully provisioning a massive 15+ resource VPC via code.
- **Challenge:** Understanding state locking mechanics with DynamoDB.

**Final Assessment:** Hardcoding destroys reusability. Strict variable typing ensures multi-environment scalability.

---

### 3️⃣ Remote State Management

**Weekly Reflection:** Migrated the vulnerable local `terraform.tfstate` to a highly available Amazon S3 backend, secured by DynamoDB state locking.

### Wins & Challenges
- **Win:** Successfully provisioning a massive 15+ resource VPC via code.
- **Challenge:** Understanding state locking mechanics with DynamoDB.

**Final Assessment:** Local state is for hobbyists. Remote state and locking are mandatory for any real engineering team.

---

### 4️⃣ Programmatic HCL Logic (`count` & `for_each`)

**Weekly Reflection:** Implemented loops to provision multiple instances instantly, and conditional ternary operators to toggle resources based on the environment.

### Wins & Challenges
- **Win:** Successfully provisioning a massive 15+ resource VPC via code.
- **Challenge:** Understanding state locking mechanics with DynamoDB.

**Final Assessment:** A single line of logical code can scale a cluster from 2 nodes to 1,000 nodes seamlessly.

---

### 5️⃣ DRY Code (`locals` & `dynamic` blocks)

**Weekly Reflection:** Refactored codebase repetition using local values for standardized tagging and dynamic blocks for nested Security Group rules.

### Wins & Challenges
- **Win:** Successfully provisioning a massive 15+ resource VPC via code.
- **Challenge:** Understanding state locking mechanics with DynamoDB.

**Final Assessment:** Don't Repeat Yourself. Computing values internally prevents drift and human error in mandatory configurations.

---

**Weekly Reflection:** Learned to protect production databases using `prevent_destroy`, and successfully pulled rogue manual infrastructure under Terraform control via `terraform import`.

### Wins & Challenges
- **Win:** Successfully provisioning a massive 15+ resource VPC via code.
